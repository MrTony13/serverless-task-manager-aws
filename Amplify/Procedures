Step 1: Preparing the React Application

I already had a React application that:

Displays a task table

Allows creating and deleting tasks

Communicates with an API Gateway endpoint

Uses Amazon Cognito for authentication

Before deploying, I ensured:

The app builds correctly using npm run build

API URLs were configurable using environment variables

No hardcoded secrets were in the code

Challenge Faced

At first, my app built locally but failed during deployment.

Solution

With guidance, I verified:

The build output directory was build/

All required dependencies were properly installed

The project structure matched what Amplify expects

Step 2: Creating the Amplify Application

I navigated to:

AWS Console → Amplify → Create New App

I selected:

Host web app

Connected my GitHub repository

Chose the main branch

Amplify automatically detected that this was a React application.

Step 3: Configuring the Build & Deployment Pipeline

Amplify generated a CI/CD pipeline automatically.

Behind the scenes:

The React app is built using npm run build

The compiled static files are uploaded to Amazon S3

Amazon CloudFront is provisioned automatically to serve the content globally

This was important because:

S3 provides durable storage for the frontend files

CloudFront improves performance with caching and global edge locations

HTTPS is enabled by default

Challenge Faced

Initially, I did not realize CloudFront was being used.

Solution

I learned that:

Amplify automatically creates and manages CloudFront

No manual CloudFront setup is required

The distribution can be seen in the AWS CloudFront console

Step 4: Setting Environment Variables

To connect the frontend to backend services, I configured environment variables in Amplify:

REACT_APP_API_URL

REACT_APP_REGION

REACT_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID

REACT_APP_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID

Challenge Faced

The frontend could not read the environment variables.

Solution

I learned that:

All frontend environment variables must start with REACT_APP_

The app must be redeployed after updating variables

Step 5: Connecting to Backend Services

The frontend communicates with:

API Gateway for REST endpoints

AWS Lambda for business logic

Amazon DynamoDB for data storage

Amazon Cognito for authentication

Authorization tokens are attached to API requests so only authenticated users can access data.

Step 6: Deployment and Testing

After pushing my code to GitHub:

Amplify automatically triggered a new build

The app was deployed successfully

A public HTTPS URL was generated

I tested:

Creating tasks

Viewing tasks from DynamoDB

Deleting tasks

Loading the app from different devices

Challenges Faced and How They Were Solved
Challenge	How It Was Solved
Build failures	Fixed build directory and dependencies
API returned 403 errors	Corrected Cognito authorizer and tokens
Environment variables not working	Used REACT_APP_ prefix
DynamoDB not updating	Fixed Lambda IAM permissions
Confusion about CloudFront
